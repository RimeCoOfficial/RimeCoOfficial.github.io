Yeah…one of our favourite moments of Sherlock as well. We have meticulously (thanks, Thesaurus) worked hard over the past few months to bring you a better experience at Rime. We have always maintained that we will give your “complete picture” to your target audience and we thusly release Rime 2.5 to make a step further. Below are the feature-set of our new release.
